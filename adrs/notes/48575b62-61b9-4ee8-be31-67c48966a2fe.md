  - cloud efficiencies:
    - A typical large-scale cloud provider achieves ~65 % server utilization rates versus 15% on-premises (source - [Data Center Efficiency Assessment](https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/data-center-efficiency-assessment-IP.pdf)). which means when companies move to the cloud  they typically provision fewer than Â¼ of the servers than they would on-premises.
    - A typical on-premises data center is 29% less efficient in their use of power compared to a typical large-scale cloud provider
