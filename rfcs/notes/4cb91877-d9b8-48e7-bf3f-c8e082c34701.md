### Formats

- Shapefile
  - specific ESRI format
  - standard format used by most 
  - comprised of 3-7 files
  - rely on old dBase IV data tables 
  - slow, large, limiting, but useful for interchange

- The [**GeoPackage open format**](https://www.geopackage.org/) is a SQLite container for GIS data (layers) in a single file. Unlike the ESRI Shapefile format, a single GeoPackage file can contain various data (both vector and raster) in different coordinate reference systems, as well as tables without spatial information

- SpatiaLite database format, like GeoPackage, is also an extension of the SQLite library
