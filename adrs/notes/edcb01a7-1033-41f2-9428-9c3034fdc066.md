## Robert C. Martin - Clean Architecture and Design

recording: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dKZ-dWaCiU>

- some back of envelope math: the numer of programmers in the world is doubling every few years => half of the programmers in the world have &lt; 5 yrs of experience 

- software is everywhere - before a programmer kills 10,000 ppl and the industry becomes a heavily regulated industry, should have discipline 

- **The architecture should scream its purpose** like architect's house plans 
  - "Object-Oriented Software Engineering: A Use Case Driven Approach" book - Ivar Jacobson
  - the web is detail - it's a type of I/O. e.g. in Unix I/O the application doesn't care what kind of thing it's writing to.

- From Ivar: 

  - **Entities** = application independent rules : even if there's no computer

  - **Interactors** = application specific business rules

  - interactor can be tested without the web/delivery mech. 

- MVC 
  - MVC goes wrong and boundaries blur

- Databases

- Story of FitNesse - acceptance testing + wiki framework  
  - deferred the database

- On testing: 
  - anything on the edge of the system is hard to test, e.g. GUI
