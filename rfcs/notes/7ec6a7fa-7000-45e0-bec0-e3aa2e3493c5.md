### [Blog] Asynchronous computing @Facebook

- <https://engineering.fb.com/2020/08/17/production-engineering/async/>
- Problem with simple priority queues: 
  - large use cases dominate
  - bad jobs stuck 
  - uneven utilization between peaks & valleys 
- Building to scale
  - introduce **delay tolerance**
  - Capacity optimization: 
    - classifying use cases:
      - daily traffic: predictable
      - major events: semi-predictable
      - Incident response: short and spikey, unpredictable
    - Time shifting: 
      - Predictive - which data may need, precomputes and cache
      - Deferred compute

    - batching: 
      - reduce # of requests to other components 
      - potential high cache reuse and code warmup
  - Capacity policy: quota and rate limiting
    - CPU instruction utilization and memory limit - when exceeded, throttle and send alert
    - rate limit on intake
