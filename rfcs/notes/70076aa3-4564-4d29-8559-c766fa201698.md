# Google BigTable

- Bigtable: A Distributed Storage System for Structured Data (<https://research.google/pubs/pub27898/>)
- hosted on GCP: Cloud Bigtable
- Inspired **Apache Cassandra** (from Facebook)
- **Spanner** is layered on top 

## Logical data model

![](/dendron-notes/assets/images/2020-11-15-16-23-55.png)

- Key (row:string, column:string, time:int64) → Value: string
- Row: 
  - data stored in **lexicographic order by row key**
  - row range = **_tablet_**
  - when storing URLs, use reversed URL as row ID so URLs from the same domain are close to each other: `com.google.maps`  `com.google.images`
- Column Families
  - Colume key: `family:qualifier`
- Timestamps
  - multiple versions of data 
  - garbage-collect rules:
    - \# of versions to keep
    - discard versions older than x days

## API

- Write - atomic operation on rows - supports single-row transactions 
  ```C++
  Table *T = OpenOrDie("/bigtable/web/webtable");
  // Write a new anchor and delete an old anchor
  RowMutation r1(T, "com.cnn.www"); 
  r1.Set("anchor:www.c-span.org", "CNN"); 
  r1.Delete("anchor:www.abc.com");
  Operation op;
  Apply(&op, &r1);
  ```
- Read - Clients can iterate over multiple column families for a row 

  ```C++
  Scanner scanner(T);
  ScanStream *stream;
  stream = scanner.FetchColumnFamily("anchor"); 
  stream->SetReturnAllVersions(); 
  scanner.Lookup("com.cnn.www");
  for (; !stream->Done(); stream->Next()) {
      printf("%s %s %lld %s\n", scanner.RowName(), stream->ColumnName(),stream->MicroTimestamp(), stream->Value());

  ```

## Implementation

- master:
  - assign tablets to tablet servers
  - detecting the addition and expiration of tablet servers
  - balancing tablet-server load
  - GFS garbage collection
- tablet servers:
  - 100-200 MB each by default
      ![](/dendron-notes/assets/images/2020-11-15-16-39-50.png)
  - tablet server holds an exclusive lock in Chubby 
  - master detect by asking each tablet server for lock status 
    - if fails, master attempts to aquire the server lock. if success, delete the server file, and move assgiment to other tablets 
    - master failure does not change assigment 
  - master at startup:
    - takes a master lock 
    - scan server directory in Chubby
    - contact tablet to learn current assigments 
    - reads METADATA to find tablets 
    - assign un-assigned tablets
