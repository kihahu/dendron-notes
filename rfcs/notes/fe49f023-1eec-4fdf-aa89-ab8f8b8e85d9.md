[Social Networking 2.0](https://stratechery.com/2020/social-networking-2-0/) from Stratechery

- 12/26/2020
- v1 digital products simply copy what already exists offline. V2 makes it better. 
  - example: peronsalized news feed + advertising vs newspapers 
- Social networks: 
  - > Twitter’s incompetence didn’t simply make Facebook’s advertising business look more dominant than it should have; it led all of us — including the FTC — to miss the point that friends and family was Social Networking 1.0: something imported from the analog world that, as time goes on, will be viewed as inferior to the far richer universe that is Social Networking 2.0.
  - real life: conflict b/w your whole self & partial interest overlap with other friends/family

    > The fact that **I am not my whole self in any of these groups is a feature, not a bug**, and one that is uniquely made possible by digital.
