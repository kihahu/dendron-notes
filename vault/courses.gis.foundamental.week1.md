- **Vector** and feature **data**
    - categorical and multivariate data 
        - e.g. each watershed has an **attribute table** 
    - Points, lines, polygons
        - Lines: 1D, can have an attribute record
        - Polygons: 2D, can have an attribute record
- **Raster data** - continuous data 
    - grid of fixed-size pixels - uniform value within in pixel
    - imagery (multiband raster data e.g. RGB) is raster data

- map documents in ArcGIS 
    - stores representation of data, provide a workspace
    - ext: .mxd
    - the map data is not embeded. 
- Orthophoto: arieal photo after location corrected to the map
- Watershed Analysis
    - NHD – National Hydrography Dataset – A dataset that contains water bodies and streamlines for the United States
        - Flowlines – the streamlines contained within NHD
        - NHDPlus – an enhanced version of NHD that adds additional attributes for each streamline, such as contributing area, flow, elevation, WBD, etc. Often used in place of NHD.
    - WBD – Watershed Boundary Dataset – a dataset containing nested watershed boundaries for the United States 
        - HUCs – Hydrologic Unit Codes – the watersheds created by the WBD
