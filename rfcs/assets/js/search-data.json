AWS Inferentia - fixed set of supported operations exposed via AWS Neuron SDK compiler \r\n    - CPU - fully programmable\r\n    - GPU - in between \r\n    - if have custom code written in high level languages, fall back to CPU:\r\n        ![](/assets/images/2020-11-20-11-31-03.png)\r\n        - NVIDIA GPUs: option to **reimplement custom code using CUDA**. \r\n            ![](/assets/images/2020-11-20-11-52-23.png)\r\n        - this is hard to do w ASIC \r\n- Target throughput, latency and cost: \r\n    - **GPUs** are throughput processors \r\n        - If latency is not critical, GPU utilization can be kept high and cost low - great for batch processing & offline inference\r\n        - if you are unable to keep your GPU utilization at its maximum at all times, due to e.g. sporadic inference request, cost / inference request goes up \r\n            - better to use **Amazon Elastic Inference** which lets you access just enough GPU acceleration for lower cost.\r\n\r\n    - CPUs are not parallel, but may be better for realtime inference of smaller models as long as latency is acceptable\r\n    - Inferentia’s performance and lower cost could be most cost effective and performant option if model is fully supported \r\n- Compiler and runtime toolchain and ease of use\r\n    - GPU:\r\n        - deep learning framework is good but not optimized\r\n        - use a dedicated inference compiler such as NVIDIA TensorRT for up to 10x speedup \r\n            - Quantization: reduce precision - from FP32 -> FR16 or INT8\r\n            - Graph fusion: fusing multiple layers/ops into a single function call\r\n\r\n### AWS Inferentia\r\n- precisions:\r\n    - automatically cast your FP32 model to BF16 \r\n    - or can provide model in FP16 \r\n- increase performance by:\r\n    - batching: reducing cost of loading weights for each layer from external memory for each input\r\n    - pipelining: load weights of different subgraphs on different NeuronCores\r\n    - both require setting options during compilation \r\n- Using all NeuronCores on your Inf1 instances: \r\n    - smallest instance type: inf1.xlarge automatically perform data parallel execution on all 4 NeuronCores (=replicating your model 4 times and loading it into each NeuronCore and running 4 Python threads to feed input to data to each core)\r\n    - larger instance: must spawn multiple threads and use python threadpools \r\n- divide NeuronCores to run different models\r\n\r\n### Amazon Elastic Inference\r\nAttached through the network using an AWS PrivateLink\r\n\r\nWhy choose Amazon EI over dedicated GPU instances?\r\n- if don’t have sufficient demand or multiple models to serve and share the GPU to keep up utilization, can attach \"just enough\" GPU acceleration to a CPU instance\r\n- The cost of the CPU instance + EI accelerator would still be cheaper than a dedicated GPU instance\r\n- EI adds some latency compared to GPU instance, but can be faster than CPU only \r\n- need to use an EI enabled framework such as TensorFlow, PyTorch or Apache MXNet\r\n\r\n\r\n## [Choosing the right GPU for deep learning on AWS](https://towardsdatascience.com/choosing-the-right-gpu-for-deep-learning-on-aws-d69c157d8c86)\r\n\r\n- G4 instance: NVIDIA T4 GPUs \r\n    -

Lots of space used in each record)\r\n\t- The **schema is a valuable form of documentation**  \r\n\t- **Keeping a database of schemas** allows you to check forward and backward compatibility of schema changes, before anything is deployed. \r\n    - **Code gen for static typed languages**\r\n- **Apach Thrift** (originally Facebook) and **ProtoBuf** (ori. Google)\r\n    - example Protobuf schema\r\n        \r\n        ```\r\n\t\tmessage Person {\r\n            required string user_name       = 1;\r\n            optional int64  favorite_number = 2;\r\n            repeated string interests       = 3;\r\n\t\t} \r\n        ```\r\n    - Field tags and schema evolution \r\n        - Each field contain the tag number and value\r\n        - Tag number can't change\r\n        - Protobuf has no list type, but `repeated` flag - can evolve from single to repeated \r\n        - Thrift has dedicated list type => supports nested lists\r\n- **Avro** - designed for hadoop\r\n    - No reference to field tag\r\n    - Record appear in order\r\n    - **Translate between The writer’s schema and the reader’s schema**\r\n    - To maintain compatibility, you must only add or remove a field that has a **default value** \r\n    - how to find writer schema: different options \r\n        - Large file with lots of records  - include the writer’s schema once at the beginning of the large  file \r\n        - Version number + database to look up schema\r\n        - Negotiate version on connection setup - AVRO RPC \r\n    - Benefit: \r\n        - Support dynamically generated schemas  - e.g. no need to hardcode translation between DB columns and schema if doing a dump\r\n        - Code generation and dynamically typed languages - Thrift and Protocol Buffers rely on code generation, not great for dynamic lang. In Avro code gen is optional - for dynamic type, can read directly\r\n\r\n#### The Merits of Schemas \r\n\r\n- Many DBs proprietary binary encoding: JDBC/ODBC driver can decode responses from the DBs’s network protocol into in-memory data structures. \r\n- Thrift, Protobuf and Avro all support schema, but simpler than XML or json (e.g. regex constraints)\r\n\r\n## Modes of dataflow\r\n\r\n### Through Databases \r\n\r\n- Backward compatibility is clearly necessary: same client, newer version needs to read older writes\r\n- Forward compatibility is also needed: newer client writes a record, a older client reads\r\n- Common error: newer client adds a field, older client update the row, that unknown field get dropped-- if it can't parse new field, should keep as-is \r\n- Data outlives code: App updates fast. Data from a long time ago is still stored \r\n\t- Schema evolution thus allows the entire database to appear as if it was encoded with a single schema, even though the underlying storage may contain records encoded with various historical versions of the schema. \r\n- Archival storage:\r\n\t- data dump will typically be encoded using the latest schema \r\n\t- Avro object container often good fit - or parquet for analytic friendliness \r\n\r\n### Through Services: REST and RPC \r\n\r\n- REST is not a protocol, but rather a design philosophy that builds upon the principles of HTTP - \"REST-ful\"\r\n    - URL as resource\r\n    - HTTP features for cache control, authentication, and content type negotiation \r\n    - it doesn’t try to hide the fact that it’s a network protocol\r\n- SOAP: \r\n    - avoid HTTP specific features\r\n    - WSDL enables code generation so that a client can access a remote service using local classes and method calls  - not as useful for dynamically typed languages\r\n- problems with RPCs pretending to be local calls - is flawed idea: \r\n    - Unpredictable, may require retry\r\n    - may not know whether succeeded or failed (in case of timeout) \r\n    - Retry and idempotence - request may be going through but didn't get successful response\r\n    - Latency longer\r\n    - Passing data\r\n- REST is usually used for external comm, RPC may be internal\r\n- Evolution:\r\n    - can assume all the servers will be updated first, and all the clients second -> only need backward compatibility on requests, and forward compatibility on responses. \r\n\t- REST api provider can store client APIs + version they are requesting to help manage. E.g. [stripe](https://stripe.com/docs/upgrades)\r\n    - Thrift, gRPC (Protocol Buffers), and Avro RPC can be evolved according to the compatibility rules of the respective encoding format\r\n\r\n### Message-Passing Dataflow \r\n- **Actor programming model**: communicates by send/receiving async messages. process one message at a time. assume message may be lost \r\n- Compared to RPC, less mismatch between local vs remote communication \r\n- example distributed actor frameworks: message broker + actor programming model\r\n    * Akka - Java’s built-in serialization by default -> no fw/bw compatibility. supports using with ProtoBuf etc. to do rolling upgrades\r\n    * Orleans - also support custom serailization plug-ins \r\n    * Erlang OTP  \r\n","url":"https://angelarwang.com/dendron-notes/notes\\e22dd5a3-f940-4548-b1d7-22a26b5386ce.html","relUrl":"notes\\e22dd5a3-f940-4548-b1d7-22a26b5386ce.html"},{"doc":"Ch03 - Storage and Retrieval","title":"Ch03 - Storage and Retrieval","hpath":"books.tech.data-intensive-applications.ch3-DB-storage","content":"\n\r\n# Chapter 3: Storage and retrieval\r\n## Data structures that power your DB \r\n### Hash indexes \r\n- Use log for writing key + value; key + value\r\n- Index: Key -> byte offsets mapping \r\n- Used by - Bitcask - default storage engine for Riak - hashmap stored in memory \r\n- Good for: value of each key is updated frequently \r\n- Log compaction:\r\n    ![](/assets/images/2020-11-02-12-51-46.png)\r\n\r\n    - Segment log files\r\n    - Keep only the most recent update for each key \r\n    - Merging and compaction is written to a new file - in background \r\n    ![](/assets/images/2020-11-02-12-57-10.png)\r\n    - After compaction, switch to new merged segment \r\n- Lookup: each segment has its own hash table.

Hashmap on disk bad perf: lots of random IO  \r\n    - **Range queries not efficient**\r\n\r\n\r\n### SSTables and LSM trees  \r\n- SSTables introduced by [Google bigtable paper](https://research.google/pubs/pub27898/)\r\n- Sorted String table\r\n    - each key only appears once within each merged segment \r\n    - Efficient merging\r\n        ![](/assets/images/2020-11-02-13-27-23.png)\r\n    - When write comes in - use in-memory balanced tree (i.e. memtable)\r\n    - After size too big: write to disk as SSTable file\r\n    - When read: first search in memtable, then in most recent on-disk segment, etc.\r\n    - Run merge and compaction in background \r\n    - Problem: crashes - most recent write is lost <-- keep a separate log for each write immediately on disk\r\n- Make LSM tree (log-structured merge-tree) out of SSTables \r\n    - keeping a cascade of SSTables that are merged in the background \r\n    - LSM storage engines: based on this principle of merging and compacting sorted files  \r\n    - Performance optimizations: bad perf if key does not exist -- use a bloom filter \r\n\r\n## B-tree \r\n- Compared to log structed indexes : MB sized segments; B tree breaks 4KB blocks/pages. corresponds more closely to the underlying hardware. \r\n        ![](/assets/images/2020-11-02-13-30-06.png)\r\n- Most databases can fit into a B-tree that is three or four levels \r\n- Grow a B tree by splitting a page\r\n- to make the database resilient to crashes: WAL - write-ahead log or redo log \r\n- Concurrency:  protect with latches \r\n- Optimizations:\r\n    - Use copy-on-write instead of WAL \r\n    - Abbreviating keys\r\n    - Try to keep leaf pages sequential - harder than LSM trees\r\n    - Additional pointers - such as sibling pages\r\n\r\n### Comparing B trees and LSM trees \r\n- LSM-trees are typically faster for writes, whereas B-trees are thought to be faster for reads  - however no conclusive benchmark\r\n- Pro of LSM trees:\r\n    - A B-tree index must write every piece of data at least twice & write an entire page at a time  - write amplication\r\n    - LSM-trees are typically able to sustain higher write throughput than B- trees, partly because they sometimes have lower write amplification \r\n    - LSM-trees can be compressed better - B-tree storage engines leave some disk space unused \r\n- Con of LSM\r\n    - compaction process can sometimes interfere with the performance of ongoing RWs - impact higher percentiles- \r\n    - If ill-configured, compaction cannot keep up with the rate of incoming writes - unmerged segments on disk keeps growing until you run out of disk space, and reads also slow down because they need to check more segment files \r\n    - B tree each key exists in exactly one place  - easier for locks & transaction semantics\r\n- B tree common in relational, LSM in newer DBs\r\n\r\n### Other strcutures  \r\n\r\n- Storing values within index:\r\n    - row is stored elsewhere (ie heapfile) \r\n    - clustered index -  row with index \r\n    - In MySQL innDB - primary key is clusterd, secondary index refer to the primary key \r\n    - Compromise: include some columns - covering index\r\n- Multi-column indexes \r\n    - Concatenated index\r\n    - Multi-dimensional index for spatial data \r\n        - Option 1: translate 2 dimensional location into a single number using a space filling curve\r\n        - Option 2: R trees with PostgreSQL’s Generalized Search Tree \r\n- Full-text search and fuzzy indexes \r\n- In memory DB:\r\n    - performance advantage of in-memory databases is not due to the fact that they don’t need to read from disk. \r\n    - But because they can avoid the overheads of encoding in-memory data structures in a form that can be written to disk \r\n    - Also offer data models difficult to implement with disk based indexes e.g. Redis \r\n    - Future: NVM (non-volatile memory)\r\n\r\n","url":"https://angelarwang.com/dendron-notes/notes\\3722a8e7-0d0f-4460-b515-a66c21a18358.html","relUrl":"notes\\3722a8e7-0d0f-4460-b515-a66c21a18358.html"},{"doc":"Ch02 - Data Models and Query Languages","title":"Ch02 - Data Models and Query Languages","hpath":"books.tech.data-intensive-applications.ch2-data-models","content":"\n\r\n# Chapter 2 - data models and query languages \r\n\r\n## Relational vs document \r\nRoots of RDMS: business data processing - mainframe in the 1960s and ’70s. \r\n-  transaction processing (entering sales or banking transactions, airline reservations, stock-keeping in warehouses) \r\n- batch processing (customer invoicing, payroll, reporting )\r\n\r\n### Object-relational mismatch\r\n- For a data structure like a résumé, which is mostly a self-contained document, a JSON representation can be quite appropriate \r\n- Document: better locality \r\n- one-to-many relationships imply tree structure- captured well by JSON\r\n- Many-to one relationships - e.g. normalizing city of people \r\n    - not easy with doc data base \r\n    - Emulate join in application code rather than database\r\n- Many to many relationships\r\n- Not a new debate:\r\n    - Hierarchical model\r\n    - Network model\r\n\r\n#### RDMS vs document databases today\r\n- Document: schema flexibility, performance due to locality, sometimes closer to data structures used by application \r\n- Which data model leads to simpler application code? \r\n    - Document: If the data in your application has a document-like structure (i.e., a tree of one-to- many relationships, where typically the entire tree is loaded at once \r\n    - highly interconnected data : document is awkward, relational acceptable, graph most natural\r\n- Schema\r\n    - Document databases - schema-on-read - like dynamic type checking \r\n        -  advantageous if the items in the collection don’t all have the same structure for some reason \r\n    - Relational - schema-on-write. -  like static/compile time type checking\r\n        -  most relational database systems execute the ALTER TABLE statement in a few milliseconds except MySQL \r\n- Data locality for queries\r\n    - Document is usually stored as single continuous string.
