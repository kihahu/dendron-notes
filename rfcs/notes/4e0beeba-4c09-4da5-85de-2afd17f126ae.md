- Transaction cost:
  - commission/fees to brokerage
  - bid-ask spread:
    - when buying, pay ask price
    - when selling, pay bid price

- overview of individual investor performance

    - in `()` = p value. only stat. significant if &lt; 0.05  
    - average household: benchmarked against simpling holding: no difference 
    - CAPM: no difference
    - 3-factor - alpha also not stat. significant
      - tilt towards value (positive coeff)
      - tilt towards SMB (institutional tend to do more large stock) - which tends to have higher bid-ask spread -> more transaction cost
  - once taken into account of transaction cost, average household under perform against the benchmarks

- loss aversion
  - assymetry:
    - tend to hold on to stock with losses (expected utility of selling is worse than holding)
        ![](/dendron-notes/assets/images/2020-12-26-16-25-19.png) 
    - tend to capture gains

  - loss-aversion good or bad?
    - go against **momentum effects**
    - against tax incentives
      - loss aversion effect is stronger in tax-deferred accounts (in regular accounts, the tax incentive reduces the loss aversion effect) - so tax motivation still matters  
  - personal connection to asset
    - emotional connection: house 
    - Genesove and Mayer(2001):
      - if house has fallen value since purchase:
        - takes longer to sell
        - effect 2x for owner-occupants
    - having someone to blame affects trading
      - ![](/dendron-notes/assets/images/2020-12-26-16-51-07.png)
      - effect is reversed for mutual funds - loss -> more likely to sell - tax effect more important, easy to blame the fund manager
  - impact on corporate finance decisions       
    - firm acquisition: 
      - offer's chance of success jumps discontinously when offer price exceeds past 52-week peak
    - equity issuance (sell stock to raise cash):
      - influenced by the stock price when a CEO joined the firm
          \-> suggest a firm with past poor stock return may need to fire current CEO if they wish to raise cash by selling equity
  - explanation for momentum?
    - when the stock goes up with good news, the cashing-in effect dampens the initial price increase
    - when stock goes down with bad news, the hold effect dampens initial drop
  - Importance of endowment effect
    - endowment effect:
      - people given coffee mug and asked if they would trade it for chocolate. 89% keep the mug
      - initially given chocolate, only 10% wants to trade it for mug
      - given both choices at start, 56% choose mug
    - tax witholding 
      - emotion on tax day: less upset with the witholding model
      - benchmark: after-tax income
    - credit card 
      - current vs future wealth
    - annuities
      - current wealth vs future consumption 
  - emotions and financial decisions
    - are psychopaths best investors? - shiv, et al 2005 
      - factors:
        - loss aversion: more likely to invest after losing last round
        - house-money effect: more likely to invest after winning
        - representatives: more likely to invest after winning

- Skill of individual investors?
  - local investments
    - on average, household allocate 1/3 to local stocks (hq within 250 miles) vs 1/8 if spread evenly 
  - concentrated accounts with 1 or 2 stocks (especially wealthy households) seems to have better information than more diversified:

  - ![](/dendron-notes/assets/images/2020-12-27-17-34-51.png)
    - various robustness tests 
      - after excluding stocks with certain characteristic, result still hold
