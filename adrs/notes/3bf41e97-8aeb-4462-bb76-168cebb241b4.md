## challenges

- monitoring
  - partial successes 
  - no easy error code like HTTP -> track #of exceptions 

- Query complexity (can have pathologically nested queries)
  1. only allow cached queries (persisted queries)
  2. calculate complexity score 
  3. calculate query depth

- caching complexity 
  1. Data loader
  2. client side caching

### GraphQL @ Twitter

- [GraphQL 2017 summit notes on GraphQL @ Twitter](https://about.sourcegraph.com/graphql/graphql-at-twitter/)
  - authN handled by a layer before GraphQL. authZ handled by  lower-level services. the GraphQL API itself no auth responsibility

  - implementing subscriptions with existing internal event bus

  - Strato: internal tech. a virtual database, aka federated database, brings together multiple data sources so they can be queried and mutated uniformly

### GraphQL Federation @Netflix

notes from 11/23/2020

- [How Netflix Scales its API with GraphQL Federation (Part 1)](https://netflixtechblog.com/how-netflix-scales-its-api-with-graphql-federation-part-1-ae3557c187e2)
- why graphQL: 
  - disparate teams building single-use aggregation layers 
  - teams building materialized views - data consistency issue
- why federation:
  - Bottleneck of the centralized graph API team - disconnected from the domain expertise and the product needs
- Studio API federated GraphQL example
  - new schema
