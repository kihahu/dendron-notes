# Chapter 2 - data models and query languages

## Relational vs document

Roots of RDMS: business data processing - mainframe in the 1960s and ’70s. 

- transaction processing (entering sales or banking transactions, airline reservations, stock-keeping in warehouses) 
- batch processing (customer invoicing, payroll, reporting )

### Object-relational mismatch

- For a data structure like a résumé, which is mostly a self-contained document, a JSON representation can be quite appropriate 
- Document: better locality 
- one-to-many relationships imply tree structure- captured well by JSON
- Many-to one relationships - e.g. normalizing city of people 
  - not easy with doc data base 
  - Emulate join in application code rather than database
- Many to many relationships
- Not a new debate:
  - Hierarchical model
  - Network model

#### RDMS vs document databases today

- Document: schema flexibility, performance due to locality, sometimes closer to data structures used by application 
- Which data model leads to simpler application code? 
  - Document: If the data in your application has a document-like structure (i.e., a tree of one-to- many relationships, where typically the entire tree is loaded at once 
  - highly interconnected data : document is awkward, relational acceptable, graph most natural
- Schema
  - Document databases - schema-on-read - like dynamic type checking 
    - advantageous if the items in the collection don’t all have the same structure for some reason 
  - Relational - schema-on-write. -  like static/compile time type checking
    - most relational database systems execute the ALTER TABLE statement in a few milliseconds except MySQL 
- Data locality for queries
  - Document is usually stored as single continuous string. So if often eed access to entire doc, performance advantage
  - Not limited to document db:
    - locality property in a relational model 
      - Spanner: rows nested in parent
      - Oracle: multi-table index cluster table
      - Bigtable, Cassandra and HBase : column family 

## Query languages

- declarative query language: 
  - hides implementation details - Improve perf w/o requiring query changes 
  - lend themselves to parallel execution 
  - Example: css
  - MapReduce query in MongoDB
    - Neither declarative nor fully imperative
    - Alternative: Mongo Aggregation pipeline: declarative - looks a lot like SQL 
    - "a NoSQL system may find itself accidentally reinventing SQL, albeit in disguise. " 

## Graph data models

- Great for many-to-many relationships 
- Can be emulated with recursive queries in Relational. But awkward
- Type: 
  - Property graph - Neo4J
  - Triple-store model
    - Resource Description Framework (RDF) - designed for semantic web - never took off 
    - Subject - predicate - object 
    - Predicate used for both property and edges
      ```
      - prefix : \<urn:example:\>.
          _:lucy     a       :Person.
          _:lucy     :name   "Lucy".
          _:lucy     :bornIn _:idaho
      ```
- Query language:
  - Declarative:
    - SparQL - for triple stores using the RDF data model
    - Datalog - predicate(subject, object) - build rules small steps at a time 
    - Cypher - neo4j 
  - Imperative: 
    - Gremlin

## Summary

- Historically, data started out being represented as one big tree (the hierarchical model), but that wasn’t good for representing many-to-many relationships, so the relational model was invented to solve that problem 
- Recently noSQL:
  - Document - when relationships across docs is rare
  - Graph  - when anything is related to anything
