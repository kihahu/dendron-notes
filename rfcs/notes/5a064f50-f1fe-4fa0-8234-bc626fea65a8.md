| ------------------ | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Activity trigger   | Push or Pull                      | cheap/fast (good for fast and lightweight steps) vs. throughput decoupled |
| Persistence level  | Only as needed or after each step | cheap/fast vs. consistent                                                 |
| Process Execution  | Sync or Async                     |                                                                           |
