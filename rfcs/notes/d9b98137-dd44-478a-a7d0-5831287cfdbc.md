## Using ArcMap for data exploration

- right click '**Identify**' to look at attributes for one item

- or multi select -> Right click on layer -> open attribute table, to see attributes of the multiple selection 

- Add a basemap for reference and change transparency (Layer Property -> Display) of the new layer to explore to overlay on top of basemap

- Right click on layer -> Data -> item description to read metadata about the file

- Layer property
  - scale dependent rendering: don't show when scale > x 
  - Choose grouping and color ramp;

  - Definition query: 
      e.g. "CumulativeArea.TotDASqKM > 5" 
  - Labels - choose label field 

- Select by attribute:
  - query:
    - use "Get Unique Values" to help find value options for query 
    - string matching `GNIS_NAME LIKE '%Sacramento River'`
  - layer -> zoom to selection 

- Calculate geometry
  - to find sum of length of rivers named X: 
      select by atttribute ->  create a new column -> calculate geometry -> statistics on the column

- Select by location 
  - after selecting some regions -> Select by location -> can find things in another layer that intersects/within/centroid lands in/ + add a radius... with the current selection 

- Export the selected data for future 

## Projections

- Datum - fixed reference point for coordinates 
- Geographic coordinate systems
- Projected coordinate system 
  - conformal - preserves local shape
  - equal area - preserves area
  - equidistant - preserve distances between points 
- common projections
  - equirectagular: equal constant distance between parallels and meridians 
  - Mercator (conformal): angles preservation, good for navigation, standard for web, optimized for calculation speed
  - Mollweide (equal area): relative area preserved but shape distorted 
  - Universal Transverse Mercator

## Geoprocessing

- Geoprocessing tool box:
  - Union: join two features (e.g. take NA map and SA map into a hemisphere map)
- Environment variables
  - change projections
  - Processing extent: limit the area to do analysis
- Spatial Join Tool

  - ArcToolbox -> Analysis Tools -> Overlay -> Spatial Join

  - JOIN_ONE_TO_ONE: use merge rule (e.g. join counties to watershed, but each watershed may go across multiple counties)
      ![](/dendron-notes/assets/images/2020-11-11-09-16-56.png)

  - JOIN_ONE_TO_MANY: each watershet + county is a new row 

  - example uses: 
    - use it for summarizaiton 
    - which road cross a river 
    - join multiple layers (e.g. electoral district + water + utility )
