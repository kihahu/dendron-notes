- **Vector** and feature **data**
  - categorical and multivariate data 
    - e.g. each watershed has an **attribute table** 
  - Points, lines, polygons
    - Lines: 1D, can have an attribute record
    - Polygons: 2D, can have an attribute record

- **Raster data** - continuous data 
  - grid of fixed-size pixels - uniform value within in pixel
  - imagery (multiband raster data e.g. RGB) is raster data

- map documents in ArcGIS 
  - stores representation of data, provide a workspace
  - ext: .mxd
  - the map data is not embeded. 

- Orthophoto: arieal photo after location corrected to the map

- Watershed Analysis
  - NHD – National Hydrography Dataset – A dataset that contains water bodies and streamlines for the United States
    - Flowlines – the streamlines contained within NHD
    - NHDPlus – an enhanced version of NHD that adds additional attributes for each streamline, such as contributing area, flow, elevation, WBD, etc. Often used in place of NHD.
  - WBD – Watershed Boundary Dataset – a dataset containing nested watershed boundaries for the United States 
    - HUCs – Hydrologic Unit Codes – the watersheds created by the WBD
