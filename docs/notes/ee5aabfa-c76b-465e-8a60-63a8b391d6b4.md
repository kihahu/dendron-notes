## GPUs vs AWS Inferentia vs Amazon EIs

[A complete guide to AI accelerators for deep learning inference — GPUs, AWS Inferentia and Amazon Elastic Inference](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-complete-guide-to-ai-accelerators-for-deep-learning-inference-gpus-aws-inferentia-and-amazon-7a5d6804ef1c)

Deep learning inference acceleration landscape

- CPUs acquired support for advanced vector extensions (AVX-512)
- GPUs acquired new capabilities such as support for reduced precision arithmetic (FP16 and INT8) further accelerating inference
- AWS Inferentia, a custom-designed ASIC 

### Considerations

- Model type and programmability: model size, custom operators, supported frameworks
  - AWS Inferentia - fixed set of supported operations exposed via it’s AWS Neuron SDK compiler 
  - CPU - fully programmable
  - GPU - in between 
  - if have custom code written in high level languages, fall back to CPU:

    - NVIDIA GPUs: option to **reimplement custom code using CUDA**. 
        ![](/dendron-notes/assets/images/2020-11-20-11-52-23.png)
    - this is hard to do w ASIC 
- Target throughput, latency and cost: 

  - **GPUs** are throughput processors 
    - If latency is not critical, GPU utilization can be kept high and cost low - great for batch processing & offline inference
    - if you are unable to keep your GPU utilization at its maximum at all times, due to e.g. sporadic inference request, cost / inference request goes up 
      - better to use **Amazon Elastic Inference** which lets you access just enough GPU acceleration for lower cost.

  - CPUs are not parallel, but may be better for realtime inference of smaller models as long as latency is acceptable

  - Inferentia’s performance and lower cost could be most cost effective and performant option if model is fully supported 
- Compiler and runtime toolchain and ease of use
  - GPU:
    - deep learning framework is good but not optimized
    - use a dedicated inference compiler such as NVIDIA TensorRT for up to 10x speedup 
      - Quantization: reduce precision - from FP32 -> FR16 or INT8
      - Graph fusion: fusing multiple layers/ops into a single function call

### AWS Inferentia

- precisions:
  - automatically cast your FP32 model to BF16 
  - or can provide model in FP16 
- increase performance by:
  - batching: reducing cost of loading weights for each layer from external memory for each input
  - pipelining: load weights of different subgraphs on different NeuronCores
  - both require setting options during compilation 
- Using all NeuronCores on your Inf1 instances: 
  - smallest instance type: inf1.xlarge automatically perform data parallel execution on all 4 NeuronCores (=replicating your model 4 times and loading it into each NeuronCore and running 4 Python threads to feed input to data to each core)
  - larger instance: must spawn multiple threads and use python threadpools 
- divide NeuronCores to run different models

### Amazon Elastic Inference

Attached through the network using an AWS PrivateLink

Why choose Amazon EI over dedicated GPU instances?

- if you don’t have sufficient demand or multiple models to serve and share the GPU to keep up utilization, can attach "just enough" GPU acceleration to a CPU instance
- The cost of the CPU instance + EI accelerator would still be cheaper than a dedicated GPU instance
- EI adds some latency compared to GPU instance, but can be faster than CPU only 
- need to use an EI enabled framework such as TensorFlow, PyTorch or Apache MXNet

## [Choosing the right GPU for deep learning on AWS](https://towardsdatascience.com/choosing-the-right-gpu-for-deep-learning-on-aws-d69c157d8c86)

- G4 instance: NVIDIA T4 GPUs 
  - go-to for inference
  - FP64, FP32, FP16, Tensor Cores (mixed-precision), and INT8 precision types
  - 16 GB of GPU memory   
- P3: if need more throughput or need more memory per GPU
