# Chapter 7: Transactions

Purpose of transactions: simplify the programming model

## ACID definition is slippery

- Atomicity:
  - different from normal meaning in concurrency programming (nobody else sees a partially updated state)
  - means more _abortability_ - when  failure, all partial updates are reverted 
- Consistency: 
  - overloaded term
  - means some _invariants_ to be true - but it's more up to application. 
  - 'C' doesn't really belong
- Isolation:
  - concurrently executing transactions are isolated from each other: they cannot step on each other’s toes
  - i.e. _serializability_ - result is the same as if they had run serially
  - in practice, **strictly serializable isolation is rarely used**. Oracle 11g doesn’t even implement it.
- Durability
  - once committed, data written is stored 
    - persisted to disk in single node
    - or replicated in multi-node

### single-object vs multi

- Atomicity and isolation apply both to single and multi-object
  - on single object:
    - almost universally provided 
      - Atomicity - log for crash recovery 
      - isolation - a lock on each object 
    - some provide atomic operations e.g. increment or compare-and-et 
  - multi-object:
    - in relational model, foreign key constraints to other table has to be met 
    - in document, need transactions to prevent denormalized data going out of sync 
    - update sconedary indexes 
- handling error
  - ACID databases abandon transactino entirely if at risk of ACID
  - quorum storage - "best "effort" 

## Weak Isolation Levels

Serializable isolation has a performance cost, and many databases - including **many popular relational DBs** don’t want to pay that price. 

### Read Committed

- when reading, only see committed data - **no dirty reads**
- when writing, only overwrite data that has been fully committed  - **no dirty writes**
- very popular - deulat in Oracle 11g, PostgreSQL, SQL Server 2012 etc.
- implementation
  - prevent dirty writes by row level locks 
  - prevent dirty reads: not by read locks, but by **keeping the old commited value and the new value set by the transaction that currently holds the write lock**.

### Snapshot Isolation and Repeatable Read

- reads might see effect of part of the transaction 
- use case where it's important and useful: **long-running, read-only queries**
  - backup 
  - Analytic queries and integrity checks
- Snapshot Isolation: each transaction reads from a consistent snapshot of the database
- Implementation
  - prevent dirty writes by locks
  - no read locks - instead, keep several different committed versions of an object - **multi-version concurrency control (MVCC)**.
    - always-increasing transaction ID

    - when reading, only read the latest committed version of the row with write tx id &lt; read tx id 
  - **Indexes** 
    - option 1: index simply point to all versions of an object, filter at read time
    - option 2: (PostgreSQL) avoid index updates if diff version on the same page
    - option 3: append-only B-trees - updates generate a new page. all parents up to root is copied and updated to new.  a particular root is a consistent snapshot of the database at the point in time when it was created. require background compaction and garbage collection. 
- naming confusion
  - different DB call it differently, and actual guarantees are different 
  - because SQL standard has flawed defintion for **repeatable read** -
