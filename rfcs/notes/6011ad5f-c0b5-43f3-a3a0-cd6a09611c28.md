## Machine Learning: The High Interest Credit Card of Technical Debt

- link to paper: <https://research.google/pubs/pub43146/>

- Complex Models Erode Boundaries
  - Entanglement
    - Generally not possible to make isolated changes - Changing Anything Changes Everything 
    - Applies to features, signals, parameter settings, etc
    - Somewhat innate to ML 
  - Hidden feedback loop 
    - ML system’s predictions end up influencing its own training data
    - May happen in surprising ways, such as two systems are dependencies of each other 
    - Can result in gradual changes not immediately visible, hard to detect and debug 
  - Undeclared consumers 
    - Changes to model impact undeclared downstream app 
    - Also potential to create hidden feedback loops 

- Dependency debt
  - Data dependency cost more than code dependencies 
    - Data dependency is harder to track than code dependencies 
    - Unstable dependency
    - Legacy features
    - Bundle features
    - episilon Features – small improvement in accuracy with huge complexity overhead
    - Correction cascade – tendency to use another model and learn a calibration layer

- System level spaghetti
  - Glue code - most of the code is not the model itself. 
  - Pipeline jungles
  - Dead Experimental Codepaths 
  - Configuration Debt
